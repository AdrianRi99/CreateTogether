# ðŸ’¡ About the Project  

**CreateTogether** is a prototype designed to foster creative collaboration within a community. Inspired by random terms, users can compose texts and share them with others. The community can revise these texts, add them to projects, and evaluate them with "likes."  

Each project includes a list of all contributors, promoting teamwork and innovation. The ultimate goal is to create engaging, high-quality text projects.  

### Please note:  
- The **user interface (UI)** is provisional and serves only as a placeholder for further development.  
- The project is in the **prototype phase**, aimed at gathering feedback and refining its direction.  

This project was developed as part of a **Bachelorâ€™s thesis** exploring the capabilities of ChatGPT in supporting software development. The entire codebase was built with assistance from ChatGPT, demonstrating the potential of AI in programming.
